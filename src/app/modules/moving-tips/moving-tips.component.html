<h1> 8 Simple Steps to a Stress Free Move</h1>
<h2> Pre-Move:</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Do Your Research-</h3>
<h4>If you have decided to hire a moving company for your up-coming move, it is important to look for online reviews and testimonials to check the credibility of the moving company before agreeing to pay a deposit or sign any document. Also, try to book your move at least a month prior to your expected move date, especially in the summer time during busy season. Taking the time to complete this step will greatly reduce unneeded stress and allow you to focus on being prepared and ahead of schedule for your upcoming move, which will save a ton of money. </h4>
<h3>Step 2: Give Yourself a Cushion- </h3>
<h4>If you’re on the ball and have everything 100% completely packed and ready to go for when your movers arrive, then a time cushion is not always necessary. Our experience has shown that a large percentage of people can become overwhelmed with juggling family, life, and the responsibilities that come along with moving; they end up not being fully prepared for the day of the move, which ends up costing more money and creates more stress for everyone involved. Therefore, if you see yourself possibly being in this situation, we highly suggest giving yourself a day or two after the move to be totally out of your current home. This allows you to seal up any loose ends (packing, cleaning, moving smaller items) after your movers have finished the job and leaves you not pulling your hair out if you’re behind schedule.</h4>
<h3>Step 3: Sell, Donate, Give Away-</h3>
<h4>If you’ve been thinking about getting rid of any unused household items, it might be a good idea to sell or donate before your move so you can make some money instead of spending more on your move. Moving into a new home is a perfect excuse to get out with the old and in with the new. Absolute Integrity Movers is proud to have partnered with the Salvation Army since its inception in 2012. Part of why we donate to Salvation Army is because they are a not for profit organization where donations go directly to the adult rehab program. Actions speak louder than words: Salvation Army’s Commissioner, Todd Bassett, receives a $13,000 a year salary to manage a 2 billion dollar organization. If your furniture is in decent condition to sell, we will be happy to donate it at our local salvation army. </h4>
<h3>Step 4: Staying on the Same Page-</h3>
<h4>We’re Absolutely sure our customers don’t appreciate surprises or hidden charges because, well, no one likes or appreciates surprises on their bill. So we’ve instituted transparency as one of our two guiding principles. Our rates and charges are simple and easy to understand. AIM uses a “3 Tier” moving system to give our customers complete control to move within their budget in a easy to understand way. We kindly ask our customers to be as specific as possible about the details of their move during the initial set-up, so we may develop a proper game-plan to serve your unique needs. For larger moves, we’ll be happy to stop by for an in-home estimate.</h4>
<h3>Step 5: Decide what Option Best Fits your Budget-</h3>
<h4>Absolute Integrity Movers uses their 3 Tier Moving System, created to give customers complete control to customize their move. </h4>
<h3>Step 6: Being prepared saves $$$</h3>
<h4>Being as prepared as possible for when your movers arrive is the #1 factor in saving money on your move. Being prepared includes: Having all or most boxes tightly packed and closed, taped, stacked, and labeled. Beds, washer & dryer, fridge, mirrors attached to dressers disassembled before the movers arrive if you prefer. (We do not charge extra for assembly/disassembly) Electronic equipment and t.v.’s unplugged, pictures and mirrors taken down from walls. Think about how you want your furniture set up in each room and where you want all the boxes, pictures, and misc. items dropped off at the new location(drop off in one room or disperse throughout the house) before the day of the move. </h4>
<h2>During Move:</h2>
<h3>Step 7: Be Present if as much as Possible-</h3>
<h4>At AIM, You are our top priority. We ask questions and give suggestions based on our experience & integrity to better serve your needs. We request that you stay present as much as possible, especially during the unload, in order to wrap up your move in smooth and quick fashion. Don’t worry about invading our space or wanting to leave us alone while we move your home, we actually prefer our customers to be close and present during the move in case we have any questions. The more involved you are during the move, the easier everything will go, saving you time and money in the process.</h4>
<h3>Step 8: Remember, you’re on the clock-</h3>
<h4>As an advocate for our customer, it is our responsibility to A.) Move your goods from point A to point B in the safest manner possible. B.) Take all necessary measures to waste as little time as possible. It is a fine line between the two, and that is where you find a quality moving company that’s dedicated to their craft. Every plan and suggestion we make to our customers is to ensure a safe and quick delivery of all your items. </h4>
